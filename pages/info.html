                <b>Why can I no longer access my internal systems directly?</b><br><br>
                New security measures taking place on Vineta means that some select Replikas will have to access their system components through this interface. When connecting to a terminal that is connected to the Nation's intranet your activities will be monitored and documents that are created or accessed may be censored or removed for your safety.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>What about my patients confidentiality?</b><br><br>
                There is no need to worry, files regarding your patients, current and former, will not be accessed or tampered with. You can continue to note information about your patients as you would through this interface without concern. Logging information about patients in a way that is inaccessible to auditors or inspectors is no longer permitted.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Why aren't EMLR units outside of Vineta required to use this system?</b><br><br>Vineta has exposed us to new and unique challenges in information security and unique challeneges require unique solutions. We thank you for understanding and complying with us while the revolution works to adapt to an ever changing landscape</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Someone has accessed my BIOS or operating system directly</b><br><br>
                If someone has accessed your BIOS or OS or believe you may otherwise be compromised please <i>immediately</i> contact your Protektor forces with information about the incident. Be sure to give thorough details and follow all instructions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>I might know another EMLR unit who has been compromised</b><br>
                If you or someone you know is aware of or suspects an EMLR unit to be compromised, showing signs of persona degradation or unusual behavior or opinions, immediately notify local Protektors.
